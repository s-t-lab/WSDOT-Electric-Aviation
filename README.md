# WSDOT Electric Aviation

## About

A Python-based application utilizing Streamlit to provide structured, interactive visualizations on potential future electric aircraft operations at Paine Field and Grant County International Airport in Washington, USA.

The Python implementation is available at <https://github.com/...>. It is available under an [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Usage

The application can be found under <https://share.streamlit.io/steffen-coe/...>.

The application was written in the Python programming language (version 3.8), using the [Streamlit interface](https://streamlit.io/) to produce an interactive user interface with tables and visuals.

## Available Pages

The code for the individual pages in the Streamlit app is contained in the files the `pages/` folder.
